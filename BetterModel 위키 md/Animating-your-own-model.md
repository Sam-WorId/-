As you can see, BetterModel supports model animation.

#### Built-in animation
There are some **built-in animation** to run automatically.

- idle
- spawn
- death
- walk
- idle_fly
- walk_fly
- jump

And there are **some special animation features** you can use for advanced animating.
- [Math animation](https://github.com/toxicity188/BetterModel/wiki/Math-animation)
- [Per-player animation](https://github.com/toxicity188/BetterModel/wiki/Per%E2%80%90player-animation)

If you complete your animation, you can test your animation by this command.
```
/bm test <model> <animation>
```
