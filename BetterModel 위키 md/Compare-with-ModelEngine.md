## Compatibility with ModelEngine assets
To reduce your learning time and use BetterModel effortlessly,  
I currently making this plugin based on [ModelEngine's wiki](https://git.lumine.io/mythiccraft/model-engine-4/-/wikis/home).  

And I currently trying to migrate MEG's feature like [MythicMobs mechaincs](https://github.com/toxicity188/BetterModel/wiki/MythicMobs-Compatibility) into BM.  
So you can use BM **by just removing MEG, drag & dropping BM** for most of MEG's assets.

> [!TIP]\
> Since there are many features shared with MEG, **I strongly suggest you to refer both of BM and MEG wiki.**  
> A plugin depending MEG's Java API is not compatible.
