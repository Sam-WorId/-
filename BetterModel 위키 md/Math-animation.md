You can put a math-expression in your keyframe by using Molang.
```
query.anim_time - current keyframe's animation time
```

> [!TIP]\
> You can learn about Molang in [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/reference/content/molangreference/?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable).  
> Since BetterModel uses external [Molang implementation](https://github.com/Ocelot5836/molang-compiler), Some features can not work properly.
